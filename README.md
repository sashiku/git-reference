# Git good with [git-reference](reference.md) 🦾

This is not an exhaustive or a comprehensive list of Git commands. My intention for this list is to have it grow organically as I learn new commands from my workflow and log them here. I was inspired by a physical print of a Git cheat sheet I received at a hackathon, it was very well laid out with good visual heirarchy; a joy to refer to. This is an attempt at recreating that as a digital reference document.

The exact version of the Github Education Git cheatsheet that I had is digitized as a markdown file: [og-reference](og-reference.md). You can find an updated `.pdf` file from Github Education [here](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)

🔎 &nbsp; Please do check out [Getting Git Right](https://www.atlassian.com/git) a wonderful resrouce by Bitbucket to learn Git. Has great illustrations!
