# git-reference
This is not an exhaustive or a comprehensive list of Git commands. My intention for this list is to have it grow organically as I learn new commands from my workflow and log them here. I was inspired by a physical print of a Git cheat sheet I received at a hackathon, it was very well laid out with good visual heirarchy; a joy to refer to. This is an attempt at recreating that as a digital reference document.

The exact version of the Github Education Git cheatsheet that I have is digitized as a markdown file: [reference.md](reference.md). For an updated .pdf file from Github Education, please do visit https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf
